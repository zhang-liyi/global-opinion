The map provides a holistic view of percent of unfavorable opinion towards China across many countries. Viewing the opinions change on-the-move shows that the year 2020 features a particularly large increase. This further suggests the impact of Covid on global opinion towards China. 

Furthermore, unlike line plots, the interactive map allows direct comparison of values between countries, in addition to comparing the change of one country across years. For example, we see that Italy was no more favorable than other countries before 2019, but the increase in negative opinions in English-speaking nations was particularly large in 2019 and 2020, making them far surpass Italy.

For some reason, `iframe` cannot output the map, a problem we haven't yet solved. To view the map, one can open and view the interactive.html file itself, which should give correct outputs.
